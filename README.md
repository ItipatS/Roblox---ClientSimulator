#  ClientSimulator - Server-Driven Visual Simulation for Roblox

https://www.roblox.com/games/72272989753542/Dust-Simulator

**ClientSimulator** is a performance-focused Roblox system designed to handle massive amounts of floating or ambient objects (like fireflies, particles, or bounce balls) â€” simulated entirely on the server and visualized on the client.

This architecture ensures tight control over gameplay logic while offloading rendering to the client for scalability and visual fidelity.

##  What It Does

- Simulates thousands of particles or floating entities on the server
- Clients receive visual-only updates (spawn, move, destroy) via `RemoteEvent`
- Built-in support for effects like:
  - Rarity-based color sequences (`Firefly`)
  - Smooth floating movement (`BallManager`)
  - Expandable to any visual object (`VoxelDust`, etc.)

---

##  Core Features

###  Server-Authoritative Logic
- All spawn/move/destroy decisions are made on the server
- Prevents cheating and ensures synchronization across all players

###  Visual-Only Client Rendering
- Clients handle appearance only, making this system scalable for thousands of objects
- Uses `FloatEvent` to sync spawn, move, and destroy instructions

###  Modular Simulation Handlers
- `Firefly`: Emits glowing particles with randomized rarity and color palettes
- `BallManager`: Spawns and moves bouncing balls in floating simulations
- `VoxelDust`: Placeholder for voxel-style particles (extensible)

##  How It Works

```
[Server]
 â”œâ”€â”€ BallManager:FireAllClients("Spawn", data)
 â”œâ”€â”€ Firefly:chooseRarity() â†’ chooseColorFromPool()
 â””â”€â”€ VoxelDust:Simulate()

[Client]
 â””â”€â”€ FloatEvent.OnClientEvent:
     â”œâ”€â”€ "Spawn" â†’ create visual entity
     â”œâ”€â”€ "Move" â†’ apply transform
     â””â”€â”€ "Destroy" â†’ cleanup
```

All updates are **batched and sent per Heartbeat or trigger**, ensuring smooth visual feedback with minimal lag.

- RemoteEvent for server-client communication
- Clean modular system (Rojo-ready)

##  Notes

> This system is designed for *internal simulation needs* where clients reflect what the server simulates.  
> While not plug-and-play, developers can reuse the architecture by plugging in their own data models and spawn logic.
